**This folder is for custom Drupal themes that are not distributed with Framaforms.**

Install these modules via Drush, using `drush dl --destination=sites/all/theme/contrib yourtheme`.

Please be aware that :
1. If you choose contribution themes as default, some content on Framaforms like pages might get broken.
2. If contribution themes are added outside of this folder, they will be deleted on update.
