## Introduction 

Framaforms is an online forms and surveys service. Registered users are allowed to create forms, share them, collect and visualize results through a simple interface. Detailed features and usage can be found [here](https://docs.framasoft.org/fr/framaforms/) (in French). 
See why we created it ([#1](https://framablog.org/2016/10/05/framaforms-noffrez-plus-les-reponses-que-vous-collectez-a-google/) and [#2](https://framablog.org/2016/10/05/en-savoir-un-peu-plus-sur-le-projet-framaforms/) in French) for further general information.

Framaforms is based on Drupal 7 and makes extensive use of the `webform` modules as well as others. 

## Installation

You don't need superpowers to install Framaforms, as it is based mainly on Drupal, however the installation can be a little more demanding as it is.

*NB : Framaforms being dependent on PostgreSQL, it cannot be "[distributed as a module](https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/distributions)" per the Drupal community standard. **However**  we are working on an easier way to install it.*

Follow detailed instructions [here](https://framagit.org/framasoft/framaforms/-/wikis/Installing-Framaforms).
